# CVTGenerator

CVTGenerator produces CVT generators on a 2D close surface.
In geometry, a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) is a special type of Voronoi tessellation or Voronoi diagram. A Voronoi tessellation is called centroidal when the generating point of each Voronoi cell is also its mean (center of mass).
